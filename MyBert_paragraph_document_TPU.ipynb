Marco Rubio (R-FL). It did not feature Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student   Colton Haab   who had been set to attend the town hall.\\nThe reason why  Haab  wasn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t there  according to what  Haab  told media in the days after the town hall  was because CNN tried to tell  him  what to say. But this argument fell apart on Tuesday after Haab\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s father Glenn admitted he had doctored an email exchange with CNN which made it look as though CNN was directing what Colton could say at the town hall. This caused even Fox News to admit  grudgingly  that the Haabs\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99 initial claims were suspect and there was no evidence CNN tried to give him a scripted question.\\n Colton Haab  was reportedly one of several JROTC students who helped protect dozens of classmates by hiding them in a JROTC classroom.  He  spoke about this to outlets such as Fox & Friends  and advocated arming trained teachers in schools.\\nCNN reached out to  Haab  about participating in the town hall  but  he  told the local ABC affiliate the day of the event that  he  refused to attend because \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cCNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d  He  showed two pieces of paper with the speech  he  had initially emailed to CNN  along with several questions.\\n Haab  went on Tucker Carlson\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s Fox News program the following evening  and said first someone from CNN asked for a speech  and then asked for \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cmore questions\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d which  Haab  said  he  was fine with. Then  he  told Carlson  the day of the event  CNN \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9chad taken what I had wrote  and what I had briefed on and talked about  and they actually wrote the question for  me .\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d  He  said  he  believed that CNN had supplied other students who participated in the event with questions  and that  he  found the whole thing \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cshocking\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d and \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cupsetting.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d\\nOn Tuesday  Haab\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s father  who had helped facilitate his son\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s communications with CNN  admitted that he had doctored an email sent to media to push the claim that CNN had told  Colton  what to say. He said he omitted some words  but did not do it on purpose  according to the AP. Both versions of the exchange have CNN asking Glenn Haab to make  Colton \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s questions shorter \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cso that we can get to as many people as possible.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d Then the key sentence: \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cThis is what  Colton  and I discussed on the phone that he submitted.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d The version of the exchange  Glenn Colton  circulated to media after the event omitted the words \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cthat he submitted.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d\\nThough  Glenn Colton  said  he  did not omit the words on purpose and \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cthere was nothing malicious behind it \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d the omission changed the basis of the conservative media\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s freakout enough that  [TGT]  to make these claims  issued a brief correction on his Tuesday show.\\n   [TGT] reviewed the story  said that CNN and the Haabs had shared the differing emails with Fox the day after the Haab interview  and that the Haabs \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9csaid they were being slandered by CNN and that is where it stood  two sides telling contradictory stories\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\xa6\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d\\n He  then got to the news of the doctored email exchange:', u'[TGT] jumped in at that point  writing: \"Yeah WTF Ben?

It also reveals a host of problems arising from the bureau\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s cooperation with  [TGT] . The eight-page memo from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) includes underlying evidence to support the claims.\\n\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cIt appears the FBI relied on admittedly uncorroborated information  funded by and obtained for Secretary Clinton\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s presidential campaign  in order to conduct surveillance of an associate of the opposing presidential candidate. It did so based on   [TGT]  \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s personal credibility and presumably having faith in  [TGT]  process of obtaining the information. But there is substantial evidence suggesting that   [TGT] materially misled the FBI about a key aspect of   [TGT]   dossier efforts  one which bears on   [TGT]   credibility \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d Sens. Graham and Grassley wrote.\\nThe letter describes a verification effort before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) so inadequate it resembles a concerted effort to conceal information from the court. However  the senators blame Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9capparent deception\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) failures by FBI and Justice  and refer  Steele  for investigation of violating federal law regarding making false statements to the U.S. government. The letter also reveals Clinton associates were feeding   [TGT] allegations that   [TGT]   used in   [TGT]   reports.\\nA salacious and unverified dossier formed an essential part of the application to secure a warrant against a Trump campaign affiliate named Carter Page. This application failed to reveal that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The application presented a Yahoo News article as corroboration for the dossier  when in fact it was sourced to the dossier\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s author Christopher Steele. The wife of a high-ranking Justice Department official also worked on behalf of the Clinton campaign effort  and her husband Bruce Ohr funneled her research into the Department of Justice. Although he admitted that  Steele  \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d this and the Ohrs\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99 relationship with the Clinton campaign was concealed from the secret court that grants surveillance warrants. The dossier was \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9conly minimally corroborated\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d and unverified  according to FBI officials.\\nEvidence supporting all of these claims is included in a less redacted version of the senators\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99 January 4  2018  referral made publicly available late Tuesday evening. A highly redacted version of the referral was made publicly available the previous day  causing Grassley to ask the FBI to aim for more transparency. The FBI had previously attempted to keep the public from learning details of its relationship with  Steele   leading Grassley to publicly decry a \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cbureaucratic game of hide the ball\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d by the FBI and DOJ.\\nAccording to the senators  the FBI relied on dossier author Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s alleged credibility \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 as opposed to corroboration or verification of his salacious and improbable claims \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 for the initial warrant application and its three renewals. The application also mentioned a Yahoo News article  but not only didn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t mention the article was sourced to an anonymous  Steele   it positively claimed it wasn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t.\\nReporter Michael Isikoff recently confirmed that  Steele  was obviously  his  source for the article  and that Clinton\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s Russia dossier project head Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS was a longtime friend. The FBI stated to the court that  Steele  had nothing to do with the article. Shopping his unverified allegations to the media was contrary to Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s agreement with the FBI. Even after  Steele  publicly testified about  his  many media contacts  the FBI hid that part of  his  dossier operation from the court and continued to rely on  his  credibility for surveillance reauthorization.\\n[REDACTED]  the application attempts to explain away the inconsistency between Mr. Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s assertion to the FBI and the existence of the article  apparently to shield Mr. Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s credibility on which it still relied for the renewal request. The application to the FISC said: \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cGiven that the information contained in the September 23rd news article generally matches the information about Page that [ Steele ] discovered doing  his /her research  [REDACTED] The FBI does not believe that [ Steele ] directly provided this information to the press\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d (emphasis added).\\nEven After Terminating  Steele  For Unauthorized Contacts With Media  FBI Claimed He Hadn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t Talked To Yahoo\\nIn footnote 9 of its January 2017 application to renew the FISA warrant for Mr. Page  the FBI again addressed Mr. Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s credibility. At that time  the FBI noted that it had suspended its relationship with  Mr. Steele  in October 2016 because of Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cunauthorized disclosure of information to the press.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\xa6 In defending  Mr. Steele\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s  credibility to the FISC  the FBI had posited an innocuous explanation for the September 23 article  based on the assumption that  Mr. Steele  had told the FBI the truth about  his  press contacts. The FBI then vouched for  him  twice more  using the same rationale  in subsequent renewal applications filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in April and June 2017.\\n Steele  Was So Political  He  Flagrantly Violated  His  FBI Agreement Over Reopening Of Clinton Investigation\\nThe FBI relayed that  Steele  had been bothered by the FBI\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s notification to Congress in October 2016 and the reopening of the Clinton investigation  and as a result \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9c[ Steele ] independently and against the prior admonishment from the FBI to speak only with the FBI on this matter  released the reporting discussed herein [dossier allegations against Page] to an identified news organization.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d However the FBI continued to cite  Mr. Steele \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s past work as evidence of  his  reliability  and stated that \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cthe incident that led to the FBI suspending its relationship with [Mr. Steele] occurred after [Mr. Steele] provided\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d the FBI with the dossier information described in the application. The FBI further asserted in footnote 19 that it did not believe that  Steele  directly gave information to Yahoo News that \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cpublished the September 23 News Article.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d\\nEven After  Steele  Publicly Admitted In Court To His Media Operation  The FBI Hid It\\nIn  Steele \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s sworn court filings in litigation in London    [TGT]   admitted that   [TGT]   \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cgave off the record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda [i.e.  the dossier] in late summer/autumn 2016.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d In another sworn filing in that case   Mr. Steele  further stated that journalists from \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cthe New York Times  the Washington Post  Yahoo News  the New Yorker  and CNN\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d were \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cbriefed at the end of September 2016 by [ Steele ] and Fusion at Fusion\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s instruction.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9dThe filing further states that  Mr. Steele \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9c subsequently participated in further meetings at Fusion\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s instruction with Fusion and the New York Times  the Washington Post  and Yahoo News  which took place mid-October 2016.\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\xa6 The first of these filings was publicly reported in the U.S. media in April of 2017  yet the FBI did not subsequently disclose to the ISC this evidence suggesting that  Mr. Steele  had lied to the FBI. Instead the application still relied primarily on  his  credibility prior to the October media incident.\\nCourt Wasn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t Told  Steele  Was \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x98Desperate\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99 To Keep Trump From Being Elected\\nThe FBI received similar information from a Justice Department official  Bruce Ohr  who maintained contacts with Mr. Simpson and  Mr. Steele  about their dossier work  and whose wife also worked for Fusion GPS on the Russia project. REDACTED  He  also noted in the same interview that  Mr. Steele  was \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cdesperate\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d to see that Mr. Trump was not elected president. None of the information provided by Mr. Ohr in his interviews with the FBI was included in the FISA renewal applications  despite its relevance to whether  Mr. Steele  had lied to the FBI about  his  contacts with the media as well as its broader relevance to  his  credibility and  his  stated political motive.', u'The diplomats said [TGT] needs to accept Kenyatta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas the basis for the dialogue that it (the opposition) and many Kenyans want.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n [TGT]held a mock inauguration Jan. 29 in which  [TGT]  was sworn in as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The government reacted by shutting down some broadcasters and arresting some participants.\\nThe government also deported  Odinga \\xe2\\x80\\x99s adviser  Miguna Miguna  despite five court orders for him to be produced in front of a judge and released on bail.\\n [TGT]claims  [TGT]  was cheated of victory in Kenya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s August presidential election by hackers who altered the vote.

My wife\\'s own gruesome story dates back to about 18 years ago  when she was a senior in high school. [TGT] vaguely offered her a film role and then proceeded to talk to her about masturbation and pubic hair. Fortunately  she managed to extricate herself as the conversation moved to the prospect of heading to a hotel room somewhere  but she was still left feeling humiliated.\\nAs a reporter for LA Weekly who\\'s covered sexual misconduct cases before  I began reaching out to a number of women who had tweeted about their own  [TGT]experiences. I spoke with a total of nine of them  all of whom revealed similar stories of unwanted sexual advances from  Toback   a mere fraction of the 38 who initially talked to reporter Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times. Since the story first published  hundreds of others  including Selma Blair  Rachel McAdams and Julianne Moore  have reportedly come forward. Most of the stories I heard followed a similar plot.\\nAmbika Leigh says she met [TGT] in 2008  when she was a 30-year-old aspiring actress and waitress at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel  and that he told her he was a director looking for an actress to collaborate with on his next film. According to Leigh  they would meet a number of times over the next two months  for lunch or dinner  and just talk. After dinner one night  she says   Toback  invited her to a house where he was staying. She says  Toback  told her  he  wanted to do some \"acting exercises\" with her  in order to build trust and establish a bond that  he  said was important to  his  filmmaking process. She was reluctant at first  but finally agreed.\\n\" He  sat me on a chair and kneeled down in front of me \" she recalls. \"Before I knew what was happening   he  was humping my shin. Humping me like a dog. It was so shocking.\" She says she found the act more pathetic than threatening. \"I started laughing at  him  \" she says. \"And then  quickly   he  came in  his  pants. I could feel the warmth on my leg.  He  totally ejaculated.\"\\nShe says  Toback  began analyzing her body  commenting on how  he  would photograph her  what parts of her  he  would allow the camera to rest upon. Next  she says   he  asked her to sit on a chair and began telling her about other actresses  he \\'d slept with  how it was part of  his  process. After what seemed like hours of just talking  she says  he  walked over \\xe2\\x80\\x93 still fully dressed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 crouched down  and started rubbing  his  crotch against her leg. \"I looked at  him  \" says Kamin  who then asked  him   \"\\'Are you trying to get off?\\' And  he  looked at me and said  \\'Absolutely.\\' I just said  \\'No  I\\'m out.\\' I grabbed my clothes and left.\"\\nI reached out to  Toback  through  his  agent  Jeff Berg  who has since parted ways with the director.  Toback  called me back on Tuesday  October 17th  four days before the Times story was published.  He  asked me if I was recording the call. I wasn\\'t.  He  told me  he  was  and that  he  wouldn\\'t talk to  me  if I didn\\'t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I wouldn\\'t believe how many times  he \\'d been misquoted   he  said. I told  him  I\\'d figure something out  and  he  said  he \\'d call back in a few hours. And so  he  did.\\n James Toback : Lemme be really clear about this. I don\\'t want to get a pat on the back  but I\\'ve struggled seriously to make movies with very little money  that I write  that I direct  that mean my life to  me . The idea that I would offer a part to anyone for any other reason than that he or she was gonna be the best of anyone I could find is so disgusting to  me . And anyone who says it is a lying cocksucker or cunt or both. Can I be any clearer than that?\\nToback: Anyone who says that  I just want to spit in his or her fucking face. I\\'m sitting here with Sienna Miller. By the way  no one who\\'s ever worked with  me  would ever say anything like that. No one. But I\\'ve just finished a movie with Sienna  which you should see  and help to get out there  called The Private Life of a Modern Woman. But here  she\\'s sitting right here  so just say hello to her.\\n[Off-the-record conversations take place  before the phone is passed back to [TGT] .]\\n Toback : No  seriously  I find it offensive and insulting and disgusting  that people\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Because it\\'s the opposite of the way I work. I don\\'t give my best friends parts unless they deserve them. Ever.\\n [TGT] : Give me one name.\\n Toback : OK  that is a total lie. I never heard of the person before. And then who was the other one? First of all  that description wouldn\\'t fit anyone  but I never heard that name before in my life. And believe me  I would remember it  because it\\'s a very unusual name.\\n Toback : Anything like that is nauseating and disgusting. And I would never say anything like \\'I\\'ll get you a film role.\\' It\\'s too stupid to dignify. It\\'s pathetic lies. It\\'s just too fucking embarrassing and idiotic. And if I were you  I wouldn\\'t go repeating it  unless you really knew it were true  because it isn\\'t. So that\\'s all I have to say. This is not worth wasting another second on.\\n Toback : OK.\\nShortly after I hung up   Toback  called back. This time  I didn\\'t record the call. He told me he thought my questions were \"really rude \" and that I should talk to someone he\\'s actually worked with. \"You can speak to a multitude of people I\\'ve worked with \" he said  \"you will never hear anything but a good word. To ignore that  and to instead quote people whose names I don\\'t know  it\\'s not a good way to deal.

Instead   he  has delivered a bill that would allow debt to continue to accrue and repayment to be put off indefinitely.\\nThe city is as exposed to bankruptcy as ever  as  [TGT] \\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan primarily deals with what checks get written when  not with the massive debt that continues to mount.\\nState Sen. Joan Huffman filed a bill last week containing  [TGT] \\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan  with one addition opposed by both  Turner  and the Houston unions: a requirement that the city get voter approval before issuing $1 billion in pension obligation bonds.\\n [TGT]  promised an end to that with the equivalent of a fixed 30-year mortgage.  [TGT]  delivered  but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a catch: Houston can take out second mortgages  third mortgages  and so on in perpetuity  each with a new 30-year repayment period.\\nAnd  [TGT]would like to kick off this journey to solvency by putting  [TGT]  next house payment of $134 million on the credit card  so to speak.\\nThe upside of the plan is that  [TGT]has won some concessions. The police and municipal employees unions are willing to trade some of their IOUs (payable by taxpayers) for cash up front at a steep discount. The firefighters union has decided to oppose the plan  but Huffman said Monday that they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill have to be brought along kicking and screaming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWhile  [TGT] achieves some concessions  [TGT] doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deliver the promised features.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cap the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exposure \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  [TGT]  told the committee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bill says that the parties are obligated to come back to the table and they shall adjust their benefits to stay within the corridor \\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is a separate cap limiting the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pension payments to 37 percent of payroll.\\n [TGT]  said Monday that if  [TGT] \\xe2\\x80\\x99s not able to use a pension bond to cover a $134 million pension contribution that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s due  then \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca lot of people will not be working.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n[TGT] pointed out that the plan lacks a 401k-like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefined contribution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d plan for new hires. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the easy first steps that struggling localities elsewhere have taken  but which  [TGT]  rejects for ideological reasons.\\nA few experts have noticed that  [TGT] \\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan  if tweaked  could be used to impose a defined contribution plan through the back door.

While   [TGT] seeks to paint a picture that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans   [TGT]  also shows that people who come to the U.S. by illegally entering the country in violation of laws are much more likely to commit additional crimes than people who immigrate here by following the law.\\n  [TGT] looks at Texas DPS crime statistics for 2015.\\nFor example  Cato\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s charts show that illegal immigrants are nearly 300 percent more likely to be convicted of a crime in Texas than a legal immigrant. Compared to native-born Americans  illegal immigrants are convicted at less than half the rate.\\nIllegal immigrants led the other categories in four types of crimes in Texas \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 gambling  kidnapping  smuggling  and vagrancy \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 Cato states. However  these cases are small in number and account for 0.18 percent of all criminal convictions in the Lone Star State.\\nIn terms of arrests for various crimes   [TGT]  reports similar numbers. Illegal immigrants are about 300 percent more likely than legal immigrants to be arrested on any criminal charge  but are 40 percent less likely than the numbers of native-born Americans arrested. Similar rates apply for arrests for homicide  but illegal immigrants are more likely than native-born Americans to be arrested for sexual assault \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 but not for convictions for the alleged assaults.\\n Cato\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s  conclusion:\\n Cato\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s  conclusion and analysis throughout point out the comparison between crimes committed by native-born Americans and illegal immigrants and the comparison of crimes by legal immigrants versus native-born Americans. However   [TGT]  appears to ignore the comparison of crimes committed by illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. with an initial mindset of violating immigration law versus legal immigrants who follow U.S. immigration law to move to this country. While the facts are shown in the charts  the written analysis does not make reference to comparisons between legal and illegal immigrants.', u'While Trump once supported abortion  he has since reversed his position  saying in his first interview after winning the election that he wants to appoint \"pro-life\" judges with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. His highly conservative nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat  Neil Gorsuch  is expected to try to carry out this mission.\\n [TGT]  would likely fall in one of two ways  according to Dawn Johnsen  a constitutional scholar from Indiana University and the legal director of NARAL Pro-Choice America from 1988 to 1993.\\nThe most drastic way the court could get rid of   [TGT] would be to overturn the case. The more likely scenario  however  would see the court letting   [TGT] stand but incrementally upholding laws that restrict access  making abortions impossible to get \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 rendering the procedure virtually illegal over time.\\nGlenn Cohen  a health-law expert and professor at Harvard Law School  said two kinds of laws provide the most likely paths for SCOTUS to overturn or undermine Roe.\\nThe gradual erosion of Roe v. Wade is a much more likely scenario for diminishing abortion access  according to Cohen  because Chief Justice John Roberts often plays the \"long game.\" Roberts hasn\\'t explicitly come out against   [TGT] or abortion (as is tradition with justices)  but he has said he respects the precedence of   [TGT] yet supported abortion restrictions in Supreme Court cases while on the bench.\\nWhat would happen if   [TGT] were overturned?\\nIf   [TGT] fell  13 states have laws on the books banning abortion  so the practice would be illegal there immediately. Other states would likely act quickly to pass similar \"trigger\" laws.\\nThat would likely become even more apparent if Roe fell.\\nHow likely is it that   [TGT] will be overturned?\\nToti said she doesn\\'t think   [TGT] is in \"any immediate jeopardy \" largely because both the Supreme Court and a majority of Americans support abortion.\\nPew Research Center polls have found that 59% of US adults today support the legality of abortion in general and 69% want the Supreme Court to uphold Roe \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 both numbers that have risen over time.\\nEven if the Senate approves Gorsuch\\'s nomination  Toti said  the court will likely still have a 5-4 majority that would uphold Roe.\\nIt will likely be some time before Gorsuch can actively participate in cases  as well. Toti estimated that the lengthy Senate approval process will sideline the new justice from deciding on cases until at least October 2017. And even if Gorsuch is aggressively anti-Roe  Trump would still need another justice to retire or die to shift the balance  an unlikely scenario in the next four years.\\nNot everyone is as optimistic as Toti. If Trump is elected for a second term  the chances of him choosing another justice go up \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 as do the chances of   [TGT] falling.\\n\"I am very pessimistic about  [TGT]   and that\\'s because I\\'m thinking about the range of ways   [TGT] can fall that would not require the Supreme Court to actually say  \\'We are overruling  Roe v. Wade  \\'\" Johnsen said. \"We\\'ve seen the kinds of laws that would shut clinics  and ban abortions for reasons  and force women to be interrogated by their doctors \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 and that all could be upheld without the Supreme Court actually saying  \\'We\\'re overruling  Roe v. Wade .\\'\"\\nErica Sackin  director of political communications for Planned Parenthood  told Business Insider that the healthcare provider is \"absolutely gearing up for a huge fight \" and that the wave of donations they received underline how many people support upholding Roe \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 including those who voted for Trump.', u'[TGT] had an off night on the offensive end of the floor but it was turnovers that hurt the Wizards the most. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\\nAs Wizards players reacted to the 109-101 loss  they lamented the sluggish start (8-of-23 shooting in the first)  the hopeless third quarter in which they scored only 14 points  and the excessive fouling that sent Curry to the stripe for 12 free-throw attempts.

Ms. Cosman  who is now deceased  was a lawyer and Renaissance studies scholar  never a medical doctor or a leprosy expert. She gave speeches in which she said that Mexican immigrants had a habit of molesting children. Back in their home villages  she would explain  rape was not as serious a crime as cow stealing.

Plus  the Bulls were \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 and still are \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 under the salary-cap floor.\\nThe notion that it\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s a matter of when  not if   Mirotic  is dealt picked up steam Tuesday.\\nIndeed  the creative structure to  Mirotic \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s deal is both blessing and curse. The collective bargaining agreement allows  Mirotic  the right to reject a trade if the second-year team option isn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t exercised.\\n Mirotic  has never backed off  his  claim to want to be elsewhere \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 and start \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 after Bobby Portis\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99 punch Oct. 17 broke two facial bones and cost  Mirotic  23 games. The deal had attractiveness to it. Last season   Mirotic  called Rajon Rondo  now with the Pelicans  his favorite teammate along with Pau Gasol. And he\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99d start for a team challenging for the playoffs.\\nBut sources said  Mirotic   for now  ultimately soured on waiving  his  guaranteed $12.5 million next season  not to mention  his  Bird rights. Those allow a team to go over the salary cap to sign  him  to a deal with higher annual raises than signing via a salary-cap exception.\\nWhether Mirotic\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s stance changes before the Feb. 8 trade deadline remains to be seen. The Bulls also could pick up his option \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 which negates  Mirotic \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s ability to reject a trade \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 and then find a trading partner.\\nThe Bulls and Jazz also remain in talks  sources said  and  Mirotic  is intrigued by the idea of playing for coach Quin Snyder.\\n Mirotic  experienced an emotional day.  It  began with  him  testing  his  strained left leg on the practice floor. Then  he  got pulled into an office by coach Fred Hoiberg and ultimately left the facility while a practice  he  wasn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t scheduled to participate in took place.\\nSources said the decision weighed on  Mirotic  heavily.  He  ultimately boarded the Bulls charter flight to Portland  Ore.  on Tuesday afternoon.\\nBefore that  Hoiberg was purposely vague regarding Mirotic\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s playing status. He answered \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cwe\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99ll see\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d and later that he\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99d \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9canticipate that he would\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d when asked before practice if  Mirotic  would travel.\\nWhat the Blake Griffin trade means for the NBA \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 and Nikola Mirotic \\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xbb', u'[TGT] .

Aidan Kelley has the story. Buzz60', u'But the keto diet is not for everyone  so I sought medical supervision.   [TGT] is an internal-medicine physician with specialty training in obesity medicine.   [TGT]   uses the keto diet routinely for   [TGT]   patients who have insulin resistance  pre-diabetes  and diabetes. In 2014   Wali  was moonlighting at a weight-loss clinic in San Francisco  where   [TGT]   saw   [TGT]   patients struggle to stick to their strict diet programs and maintain their weight loss.   [TGT]   started reading studies on low-carb diets and became convinced it was the solution.   [TGT] made   [TGT]   a guinea pig before   [TGT]   prescribed the diet. And it worked.   [TGT]   said   [TGT]   \"expected to feel a lot of adverse side effects\" from eating so much fat  \"but what ended up happening was I felt great. I started to have more energy and concentration. I didn\\'t lose weight  but my fat distribution changed  so I lost weight from my hips.\"\\nAfter asking me about my family history and my reasons for trying the keto diet    [TGT] determined I was an \"optimizer \" like the healthy tech workers who rely on the diet. Tech workers living in the Bay Area sometimes go to extreme lengths to improve their bodies and minds. For example  at the supplements startup HVMN (formerly known as Nootrobox)  most employees don\\'t eat on Tuesdays \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 a ritual they say improves ketone production and productivity. Intermittent fasting has been shown to assist ketosis. To see if I was a good fit for the keto diet    [TGT] requested I have some lab work done  including a cholesterol panel and a fasting insulin level test. My results came back normal  which meant there was no medical necessity for me to go on the diet. If I were pre-diabetic or insulin-resistant    [TGT] would have been more likely to make the keto diet part of my treatment.\\n  [TGT] introduced me to the \"keto food pyramid \" via this image that went viral on Reddit. We agreed that for my first week on the keto diet  I would aim for 30 to 50 grams of carbs during the day and eat regular  carb-heavy dinners  even if they took me over the limit. \"Sugar addiction is a real thing  \"  [TGT] warned me in our first meeting.   [TGT]   wanted me to ease into ketosis to avoid \"carbohydrate withdrawal \" which can cause irritability  depression  headaches  lethargy  and nausea. I was happy to take it slow. As I was learning the carb loads of different foods in those first few weeks  I tracked my meals on the Fitbit and Weight Watchers apps  but   [TGT] says paper and pen works just as well.\\n  [TGT]   taught me how to count carbs the smart way: Carbohydrates - dietary fiber = net carbs. Fiber is a carbohydrate that the body can\\'t digest. It doesn\\'t raise blood-sugar levels  so there\\'s no use in counting grams of dietary fiber toward a daily carbohydrate goal. A cup of almonds has approximately 20 grams of carbohydrates  but 12 of those come from dietary fiber. As a result  I had to count only 8 grams for the serving. What a bargain!\\nWhen I got home from my visit with   [TGT] I was forced to rethink all my dietary staples. I let my boyfriend finish off our supply of apples  bananas  bread  pasta  rice  and potatoes.\\nOur office has the best snacks \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 Goldfish  Nature Valley bars  animal crackers  and peanut-butter-filled pretzels (my personal brand of indulgence). I thought of them often. I used to snack every hour between 10 a.m. and dinner. Food was always on my mind. In my first week  I dug up the willpower to resist those sugar binges. But it was not without consequences. My headaches pounded for hours on end. My mind said  \"Eat something.\"   [TGT] recommended I drink more water and salt my food to ease the headaches.\\nDuring Week 2  my ketone testing meter kit arrived in the mail. The pocket-sized medical device uses a small blood sample to measure the presence of ketones. People diagnosed with diabetes can have a ketone testing meter prescribed by a doctor  but it may not be covered by insurance. Optimizers like me turn to Amazon for third-party sellers. I bought the Precision Xtra Glucose Meter Kit (which also measures ketones) for $22  and a 10-pack of ketone testing strips for $42. The meter has since gone up to $99 on Amazon. Keto adherents use ketone testing meters to check that they\\'re in a state of nutritional ketosis  which is generally considered above 0.3 millimoles per liter of blood  according to   [TGT]  . Entrepreneurs sometimes share their ketone levels on social media. It\\'s the biohacking community\\'s equivalent of posting photos of a bathroom scale to celebrate recent weight loss.\\nWhen I splurged on a bagel or pizza  which did happen  I wanted to curl up under my desk and nap within 30 minutes of eating. I felt uncomfortably full and groggy. The worst part of cheating was that it had the potential to reverse a state of nutritional ketosis. When my parents came into town over one weekend and I went rogue  I wound up with a ketone reading of 0.3 mmol/L  which meant my body was burning more carbs than fat. I returned to the diet on Monday  but it takes an average of five days for the body to use up the leftover glycogen reserves and return to nutritional ketosis  according to   [TGT] \\nAfter eating mostly fat  protein  and leafy vegetables for one month  I reached my peak ketone reading of 0.9 mmol/L \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 a strong indication that I reached a state of ketosis. By this point in my journey  most of the negative side effects had subsided. (I experienced leg cramps and tingling sensations in my feet  which   [TGT] explained was from eating too little salt.   [TGT]   suggested I try magnesium supplements  and the problem went away within days.) A ketone reading of 0.9 mmol/L indicates a mild state of ketosis. Dieters can reach higher levels \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 \"go deeper\" into ketosis \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 by restricting carbs to fewer than 20 grams a day or fasting. But there isn\\'t consensus in the medical community that doing so unlocks additional benefits. Geoff Woo  the cofounder and CEO of HVMN  said he aimed for 3.0 mmol/L or higher  which he achieves through intermittent fasts that spike ketone production  for \"optimal mental flow.\" When I started to obsess over the numbers my ketone testing meter gave me    [TGT] encouraged me to focus on how I felt instead.\\nIt was then that I realized why I loved eating keto \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 it made me feel like a superhero. When I lost 30 pounds on Weight Watchers in college  I celebrated the numbers on the scale and how my clothes fit. But because I continued to eat carbs in smaller portions  I was still prone to sugar crashes and afternoon \"brain fog.\" The transformation was incomplete. The keto diet made over my mind and my body. The sense of mental clarity and energy that came on about three to four weeks into eating keto was unlike anything I\\'ve experienced. I woke up feeling strong  confident  and capable of taking on whatever the day threw at me. \"This is how you\\'re supposed to feel as a human being  \" Wali  said during a follow-up visit.', u'The tokens investors get when they buy a cryptocurrency  like Bitcoin  can be used to buy into blockchain startups (businesses that use the same online ledger as cryptocurrencies).

That was all. She had put it aside  one cent and then another and then another  in her careful buying of meat and other food.  Della  counted it three times. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. There was nothing to do but fall on the bed and cry. So  Della  did it.\\nThat\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s how the story of  Della  and  Jim  begins.

Something nearly good enough.\\nSomething almost worth the honor of belonging to  Jim .\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d\\nThe first thing that shines through this extraordinary little tale is the love  Della  has for  her Jim . When she finally cries her way into figuring out how to make a little extra money and discovers the perfect gift \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 a pocketwatch chain for  Jim \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s only thing of value  an inherited gold watch \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 there\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s not a sentence in literature that expresses more profound affection:\\nIt was a gold watch chain  very simply made. Its value was in its rich and pure material. Because it was so plain and simple  you knew that it was very valuable. All good things are like this. It was good enough for The Watch. As soon as she saw it  she knew that  [TGT] Jim  must have  [TGT] . It was like  him . Quietness and value\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94Jim and the chain both had quietness and value. She paid twenty-one dollars for it. And she hurried home with the chain and eighty-seven cents.\\nI won\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t give away the ending (seriously  read it)  but let\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s just say O. Henry is known for delivering a twist ending that makes M. Night Shyamalan look like a film school novice. And what  Della  and  her  husband discover in their mutual search for the perfect gift is the beauty of sacrifice for the beloved. And if that isn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t the story of God sacrificing his only son to the sin and violence of mankind because he so loved the world  I don\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t know what is.\\nThe sacrament of marriage is supposed to mirror the connection that God has to his church.  Della  and Jim embody that connection  selflessly giving up the things they value to show their love for each other  and being content in the discovery that those sacrifices don\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t always yield quite what one expects. But often the act of sacrifice is enough. O. Henry compares his characters\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99 sacrifice for each other to the gifts of the Magi (the Wise Men)  brought from far-away lands to honor the birth of the baby Jesus. Because in the selfless act of love  even when it goes hand in hand with the mistakes  Della  and  Jim  make  there is wisdom. Maybe infinite and ineffable wisdom.\\nI never thought of Christmas the same way again after that reading. I had to go back and re-read that story many times over the years; something always compelled me to do so  and that something was planted during the 10 minutes I spent sitting with my father  listening to him gently tell the tale of  Della  and  her Jim .

chamber\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s two chiefs  Majority Leader  [TGT]  (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  who have clashed for several years over Republican filibusters of Obama\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s agenda and nominees.\\nPrevious majorities had threatened to upend filibuster rules in this manner  but relying on a simple majority vote had been used only for relatively minor procedural changes to how amendments were handled  never to eliminate the super\\xc3\\x82\\xc2\\xadmajority requirement altogether. Before Thursday  the standard precedent was that major rule changes needed a two-thirds majority. The change was so significant that  Reid  and  his  leadership team held a victory party with liberal activists afterward in a room just off the Senate floor.\\nAfter the vote   Reid  told reporters that  his  views on the issue had evolved \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x94 from eight years ago  when Republicans held the majority and  he  led the fight to protect the filibuster.  He  acknowledged that  he  wouldn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t mind seeing the supermajority requirement abolished for everything but that there were not enough votes in  his  caucus to support such a move.\\n Reid  first faced pressure on this issue from junior Democrats four years ago  particularly Sen. Jeff Merkley  a former speaker of the Oregon state House  who became the point person for growing the anti-filibuster movement. But  Reid  repeatedly rejected their effort as too radical.\\nEven if Republicans want to do away with the filibuster someday   Reid  said  Thursday\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s move was worth it because the current climate had become too hostile to get anything significant done.  Reid  said  he  faced a choice: \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cContinue like we are or have democracy?\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d', u'New England Patriots quarterback   [TGT] has a chance to increase   [TGT]   MVP trophy collection when   [TGT]   team faces the Philadelphia Eagles this week in Super Bowl LII.\\n  [TGT] won   [TGT]   fourth Super Bowl MVP title in 2017  surpassing Joe Montana\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s previous record three with the San Francisco 49ers.\\n2017:   [TGT]  ; New England Patriots\\n  [TGT] was named Super Bowl LI MVP in 2017 after the quarterback led   [TGT]   team to victory following a 25-point deficit at the half.

View As: One Page Slides\\n1. Impeccable pattern recognition. In 1975  Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard after just two years. He reportedly spent more time using computers in the computer lab than studying for exams. Gates  along with his co-founder Paul Allen  realized that the personal computer was going to need software to run it successfully. After purchasing an Altair 8800 (an early home computer)  he and Allen projected that a computer would eventually make it into every home in the United States. In 2004  Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard sent an email to Elon Musk  who had already successfully participated in PayPal and founded SpaceX  asking for an interview to discuss an investment in his new electric car company. Musk  who had believed in the power of electric cars for a decade  was keen to invest. Musk\\'s involvement generated a $7.5 million round of funding. Eventually Musk would go on to become the chairman and CEO of Tesla.   [TGT] founded Amazon in 1995. At the time Amazon only sold books  though   [TGT] knew from the moment   [TGT]   founded  [TGT]  that the ecommerce platform should become an \"everything store.\" When Amazon was founded  eBay did not exist  and Barnes and Noble was not yet selling books online.   [TGT] had a premonition about the future  and acted quickly to establish what is now a nearly $500 billion company.\\n2. Faith in themselves and in their founding teams. Gates  Bezos and Musk all had profound belief in their own capabilities and those of the founding members of their teams. It is one thing to have a visionary idea; it is another thing to drop out of Harvard  invest millions in a small electric car company or risk insurmountable debt.  Take  [TGT] as an example. After graduating from Princeton    [TGT]   eventually ended up as a senior vice president of DE Shaw  an investment company. When  he  hatched the idea of an online bookstore   he  left  his  job at DE Shaw in the middle of 1994. In other words    [TGT] walked away from a considerable end-of-year bonus in favor of founding a small company headquartered in   [TGT]   garage.\\n3. High risk tolerance. Founding a startup entails a great deal of risk. One study found that after 10 years of being in business  96% of startups fail. This means that  statistically speaking  Gates  Musk and   [TGT] were facing tough odds when  [TGT]  decided to leave otherwise comfortable lives to start a risky business venture. For example  Musk left   [TGT]   PhD program at Stanford University to found a company called Zip2 with  his  brother.  [TGT]  was sold to Compaq  netting Musk a bit over $20 million. But rather than pocket the cash and ride off into the sunset  Musk once again took a great risk by investing millions of dollars to found a company called X.com  which would later merge with another company to form PayPal.\\n4. Preference for horizontal or vertical integration. Microsoft  Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX are all organizations that tend to prefer vertically integrated products. A critical component of Microsoft\\'s development was the horizontal integration with other software platforms through acquisition. For example  in 1994   [TGT]  acquired SOFTIMAGE  and a year later it acquired Altamira. Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX all embrace vertical integration. Amazon is already developing their own brand of products called Amazon Basics  and is working on delivery systems as well. This means that    in the near future  Amazon will produce  retail and distribute  their  products  owning the production chain from start to finish. Tesla not only produces electric cars; they also educate the public about their cars via Tesla showrooms across the country. And SpaceX doesn\\'t just launch rockets; they develop their own rocket architecture as well.', u'The voluntary poll is non-binding but   [TGT] immediately said   [TGT]   would fulfill a pledge to raise a bill in parliament with the aim of passing laws by Christmas.\\n  [TGT] played down concerns of a split in   [TGT]   coalition government over the policy as the conservative faction presses for amendments to protect religious freedoms that discriminate against same-sex couples.\\n\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cIt is unequivocal  it is overwhelming.

There was a Bible nearby  and he was positioned near the crack under his door  as if he were struggling for fresh air  according to the Miami Herald.\\n Jordan-Aparo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  death in September 2010 became the subject of multiple probes  including an inquiry by the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. A federal grand jury returned no indictments.\\nBut a federal lawsuit by  Jordan-Aparo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  family is underway  and they recently won a key victory in the case.\\nThe lawsuit was brought by Jordan-Aparo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 12-year-old daughter  who was 6 when he died  and her mother. It describes  Jordan-Aparo  as an orphan who was adopted after  his  biological parents committed suicide together when  he  was 5 years old.  He  had a criminal history of nonviolent crimes that included drug possession.\\n Jordan-Aparo  was sent to the Franklin Correctional Institution in northwest Florida in October 2009.  He  had pleaded guilty to credit card fraud and was set to serve a 20-month sentence.  He  was a minimum security prisoner  set to be released in early 2011.\\n His  disability  Osler-Weber-Rendu disease  is a genetic disorder that causes people to develop abnormal blood vessels  which can lead to anemia  severe bleeding and pulmonary complications.\\nOn Sept. 15  2010   he  went to the prison infirmary with pain in  his  back and  his  side. Nurses recorded a body temperature of 102.4 degrees. The lawsuit says  he  had a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cserious infection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d caused by  his  disease.\\nMedical staff \\xe2\\x80\\x9cordered bedrest and Tylenol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and sent  him  back to  his  cell  according to the complaint.\\nTwo days later   he  went back to the infirmary  the pain on  his  left side so bad that  he  couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give a urine sample. It was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmedical emergency \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  he  said. Drink more water  a nurse told  him .\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe medical services provided to  Aparo  were objectively insufficient \\xe2\\x80\\x9d it adds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a deliberately indifferent and reckless disregard for the treatment of  Aparo \\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical needs and disability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nLater that night  he reported to the infirmary two more times. His heart rate had soared above 100 beats per minute and he was having trouble breathing. An inmate told a correctional officer that  Jordan-Aparo  was so sick he had passed out on a toilet and pleaded to go to a hospital  according to the complaint. Prison workers again sent him to a disciplinary dorm for threatening to sue a nurse if he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taken to a hospital.\\nThe lawsuit says he was murdered  and accuses prison workers of wrongful death. The alleged motive:  Jordan-Aparo  had been an informant against guards at another prison. Additionally   it  alleges conspiracy  violation of  his  constitutional rights  and violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act.

The Colts and  McDaniels  can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t execute a deal until he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fulfilled his duties with the Patriots.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming  and  McDaniels  seemingly has been thinking about this moment for quite a while.  He \\xe2\\x80\\x99s been entertaining the idea of pursuing another head-coaching gig for some time  but this year  he  finally felt the time was right. For  McDaniels   it was a matter of when  not if.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a dream of mine forever \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  he  said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a football coach all my life. I grew up around the game. I played as long as I could but I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very big or very fast or very good. So  I knew I was going to end up being a coach somewhere  somehow. I just wanted to try to get better and whatever the cards held for me  that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be OK with that.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight now  this week is special for one reason and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here with an opportunity to compete against the Eagles for the Super Bowl championship \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  McDaniels  said  staying on message.\\nBut when the opportunity to be a head coach comes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 cough  next week  cough \\xe2\\x80\\x93  McDaniels  clearly plans to do things differently after the apparent personality conflicts  he  left in  his  wake in Denver.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have people you learn from every day and you have people that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re responsible to teach \\xe2\\x80\\x9d  he  said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the only way for those two things to work the right way is to have quality relationships.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) officially lost the support of many of  his  colleagues Wednesday  when more than 20 Democratic senators and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee called on  him  to step down amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations  including groping and kissing women without their consent.\\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  who has been a leader on raising awareness about the epidemic of sexual misconduct  was the first to call on  Franken  to go.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been shocked and disappointed to learn over the last few weeks that a colleague I am fond of personally has engaged in behavior towards women that is unacceptable \\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in a Facebook post. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI consider  Senator Franken  to be a friend and have enjoyed working with  him  in the Senate in our shared fight to help American families. But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary  and it is painful. We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than any one industry  any one party  or any one person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nToday  I am calling on my colleague  [TGT]to step aside. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve struggled with this decision because  he \\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a good Senator and I consider  him  a friend. But that cannot excuse  his  behavior and  his  mistreatment of women.

Rialmo   meanwhile  took the unusual step of suing the city  alleging in part that he was inadequately trained.

So last year  he  blew off the UN-sponsored peace talks led by Staffan de Mistura  and  he  joined with Iran and Turkey to form  his  own \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cpeace talks\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d process held in Astana  Kazakhstan. And they came up with a peace plan.\\nOf course  the peace plan was rejected by the parties actually fighting in Syria: the Syrian regime led by the psychopathic president Bashar al-Assad  the \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9cmoderate\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x9d anti-Assad opposition in Syria  the al-Qaeda linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)  formerly Jabhat al-Nusra  al-Nusra Front  and the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh). All of those four groups rejected the peace plan  so it was ridiculous for  Putin  or anyone else to believe that the peace plan would work.\\nAnd it didn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99t.

Less than two months later  it is clear that   [TGT]  \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s announcement was garbage.
